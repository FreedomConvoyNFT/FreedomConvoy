      <h2>Buyer's Guide to Crypto</h2>
      
      <p>Interested in buying a Freedom Convoy NFT but you don't know much about this "cryptocurrency" stuff? We'll be honest, it's a little complicated. But we're here to help!</p>
      
      <p class="q">1. Set up an account with a cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
      <p class="a">You want an exchange that can handle both regular money (e.g. CAD/USD) and the cryptocurrency "MATIC." We like <a href="https://ndax.io/">NDAX</a>, but there are many options that will work. Some of the following steps will assume you used NDAX, but the process should be <em>fairly</em> similar for other exchanges.</p>
      <p class="a">Whichever exchange you choose, they'll ask you for a bunch of information including a photo of your government-issued id. That's because cryptocurrency exchanges who deal in real money fall under a lot of the same regulations as banks, so they need to be really careful to confirm your identity.</p>
      <p class="a">Once they've got all your info there is often a bit of a delay while they confirm everything. NDAX says it can take as much as 2 days, but for us it was less than 5 minutes.</p>
      <p class="a">Note: If you aren't comfortable giving all this personal information to a website, there ARE ways of doing this that don't require anything more than a mobile phone number. But they're even more complicated than this guide! (and we know, this guide is already pretty complicated! This was the simplest way we could find!!) You can <a href="mailto:freedom.nft.2022@protonmail.com">email us</a> to ask for some tips to get you started down this path if this is of interest to you, but you'll need to do some of your own research to fill in some blanks.</p>
      <p class="q">2. Deposit money</p>
      <p class="a">Once they've verified your identity, transfer some money into the account. We recommend about $100 CAD per NFT that you want to buy. We don't think you'll need quite that much, but cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate rapidly and gas fees are difficult to predict, so it's good to have a little extra in there. Once you've got your NFT(s), you should have a little MATIC left over that you can use to explore other types of cryptocurrency activities!</p>
      <p class="a">When you're logged into your NDAX account, click the "Deposit" button. There may be a couple of extra steps here where they get you to set up two-factor authentication for extra security. But then you should get to a page that tells you how to deposit Canadian dollars into your NDAX account using an Interac E-transfer (you can also use a wire transfer, but that's slower and more expensive).</p>
      <p class="q">3. Buy MATIC</p>
      <p class="a">Once you've got CAD showing up in your NDAX account, click the Trade button. There will be a big list of cryptocurrencies you can buy, with lots of charts and numbers. It can be a bit overwhelming, but just focus on that list. Look for MATIC/CAD and click on it. It'll show you (among other things!) the current price of MATIC in CAD (recently it's generally been between $2-3 per MATIC).</p>
      <p class="a">With MATIC/CAD selected, click the green BUY button. In the window that pops up, click 100% and then "Place Buy Order." This will convert all of the CAD in your NDAX account into MATIC at the current market rate.</p>
      <p class="q">4. Set up your own personal crypto wallet.</p>
      <p class="a">At this point, you own some MATIC. Good work! But it's still in the NDAX exchange. In order to buy an NFT with it, you need to get it out of the exchange and into your own personal crypto wallet. This wallet is also where your NFT will go after you buy it. We recommend <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> for setting up your wallet. You can install it as an app on your phone, or as a browser extension if you use the web browser Chrome on a desktop computer.</p>
      <p class="a">If you want to use a different wallet, make sure it supports the Polygon blockchain.</p>
      <p class="a">Install Metamask from their website by following their instructions. They'll want you to set up a password, and write down a series of words. (those are important in case you ever forget your password!)</p>
      <p class="q">5. Connect your wallet to the Polygon network.</p>
      <p class="a">By default, Metamask is only connected to the Ethereum network. Our NFTs are on a different network, called Polygon (or sometimes Matic -- they changed the name a while ago and some places still use the old name). If you're wondering why we use Polygon, check our <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>! But this means you'll need to add the Polygon network to your Metamask wallet.</p>
      <p class="a">The easiest way to do this is to visit <a href="https://polygonscan.com/">Polygonscan</a>, scroll down to the bottom of the page, and click the "Add Polygon Network" button. Metamask should pop up with information about the network. Click "Approve" to add it!.</p>
      <p class="a">If that doesn't work for any reason, follow the "add the Polygon network manually" process from the <a href="https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask#add-the-polygon-network-manually">Polygon documentation</a>.</p>
      <p class="a">After you've completed this step, open Metamask again and make sure the network (up at the top) is set to "Matic Mainnet" or "Polygon Mainnet" instead of "Ethereum Mainnet." (click on it and change it if it's not)</p>
      <p class="q">6. Transfer MATIC from the exchange to your personal wallet.</p>
      <p class="a">This has been a complicated journey but we're almost there!! Go back to the <a href="https://ndax.io/">NDAX</a> website (you may have to log in again) and click on the "Wallet" button. We want to move our MATIC from the wallet inside the NDAX exchange into the Metamask wallet we just set up. On the NDAX wallet page, click on MATIC, then SEND. It will ask you to select a network; select POLYGON.</p>
      <p class="a">Now it will ask for an address to send the MATIC to -- you need the address for your Metamask wallet. Go back to Metamask. Up at the top there should be an account name (probably "Account 1") and underneath it there should be a string of gibberish that starts with 0x and has a "..." in the middle. That "..." indicates that it's not even showing you the whole thing -- wallet addresses are long!! Click on the address and it should copy it to your clipboard. Switch back to NDAX and paste the address into the "Matic Wallet Address" field. You may want to switch back and forth a couple of times just to double check that the beginning and end of the address are correct -- these transactions cannot be reversed if you mess something up!</p>
      <p class="a">In "Amount of Matic to Send" enter however much MATIC you have, minus the transaction fee (usually 2 MATIC). This will move all of your MATIC tokens into your Metamask wallet so that you can use them for NFTs!</p>
      <p class="a">Switch back to Metamask and wait a few minutes until the MATIC shows up there. Polygon Network transactions are faster than some cryptocurrency networks, but don't worry if it takes a minute or two. Once the MATIC shows up in your Metamask wallet, you've done the hard part! Good work!!</p>
      <p class="q">7. Mint your own Freedom Convoy NFT!!</p>
      <p class="a">If you've made it this far, you're all set! Just go to our <a href="/">minting page</a> and click "Connect" to connect your Metamask wallet to our website, then mint yourself a Freedom Convoy NFT!! The cost is 30 MATIC for each one, but there will be a small transaction fee on top of that, so make sure you've got a little more than 30 MATIC available. The NFT should be created and added to your wallet within a few seconds. Metamask doesn't display NFTs, but you can see NFTs in your wallet by visiting <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a> and linking your Metamask wallet there.</p>
      <p class="a">Congratulations! You've entered the strange new world of cryptocurrency and NFTs, and you've got yourself a unique memento of the historic Canadian FREEDOM CONVOY!! Now that you've got all these accounts set up, you're in a great position to learn some more about cryptocurrencies and maybe even invest further in this exciting new technology. It's a great way to engage in commerce or trade with other people without the government interfering at every step. Good luck!</p>
