      <h1>NFTs for the Canada Freedom Convoy 2022</h1>
      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <p class="q">What is an NFT?</p>
      <p class="a">An NFT, or "Non-Fungible Token," is a unique digital item that can only be owned by one person at a time. There is often a piece of art attached. In our case, our NFTs each feature a unique truck with slogans or symbols of the Canadian Freedom Convoy of 2022. The technology behind NFTs is fairly complicated, but if you want to learn more you can check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">Wikipedia entry</a> as a good starting point.</p>
      <p class="q">What can I do with one of these NFTs?</p>
      <p class="a">Your NFT goes into your digital wallet, where you can keep it as a memento of this historic event. You can also use it as a profile picture, share it on social media, etc -- to show the world how much you care about FREEDOM! And later on, you have the option of selling it to someone else on an NFT exchange like <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>. Since NFTs are each unique and typically limited in numbers, they can often be sold for many times more than you paid for them.</p>
      <p class="q">It might be worth more later? How much more?</p>
      <p class="a">That's impossible to say. The NFT market is very volatile. But to give some examples, the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs were 0.08 ethereum when they launched (around $300 CAD at current prices) and now they routinely sell for over 80 ethereum (over $300,000 CAD). CryptoPunks were originally free, and now sometimes sell for over $1 million each. Both of these high-profile examples are NFTs that only include a silly little piece of art. Our NFT is a piece of art AND a piece of HISTORY!! Do you think people will want them in the future? We sure do! And if we're right, there will only ever be 1000 of them, so prices could go sky high!</p>
      <p class="a">Of course, nobody knows what will happen in the future, so we can't promise anything here. But we can hope!</p>
      <p class="q">OK wait, what is the deal with all of this "cryptocurrency" stuff?</p>
      <p class="a">That's a bigger subject than we can really fully cover in a single FAQ question, but if you're interested in FREEDOM, you might want to look into it a bit more!! Most money you're familiar with, like Canadian or US dollars (also called "fiat currency"), only has value because the government of a country SAYS that it has value. It's just made-up value. And the government who makes the money controls that money. Cryptocurrencies are a way of exchanging value between two people without a government getting in between. Governments are trying to find ways to profit off the cryptocurrency boom, but so far it's still a much more decentralized and FREE way of trading with other people than using government-backed currency. If you're interested in freedom, this is an area you might want to research some more!</p>
      <p class="a">In the cryptocurrency space you'll often see people use the acronym DYOR -- "do your own research." It's a big, complex subject, but it's really interesting and freeing when you learn about it. If you like learning from videos, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsYYksPHiGqXHPoHI-fm5sg">Whiteboard Crypto</a> has some good youtube videos on various crypto-related subjects that can make a great starting point!</p>
      <p class="q">What if I want one but I don't get it before they're sold out?</p>
      <p class="a">We'll only be making 1000 in this series. If they're gone before you get to them, you can check <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/freedom-convoy">our Opensea Collection</a> to see if anyone is selling one!</p>
      <p class="a">If demand is really insanely high, we <em>may</em> make a second set of NFTs, but they won't be the same as these first ones! We won't do anything that could reduce the rarity and value of these first Freedom Convoy NFTs.</p>
      <p class="q">You say that these NFTs will let us "show our support" for the Freedom Convoy. But will buying one actually support the protestors in a tangible way?</p>
      <p class="a">We hope so, but we haven't worked out the details yet. Our original plan was to contribute a portion of the proceeds to the Freedom Convoy GoFundMe, but as you've likely heard, that was shut down by the "powers that be." We see they have a new fundraising platform set up, but we want to be confident that the funds will go to actual protesting truckers before we contribute. So it is our <em>intention</em> to provide tangible support to the protesting truckers through this project, but we have to sort out the best way to do that first. We'll update this answer when we get it figured out!</p>
      <p class="q">What is MATIC? The Polygon Network? And why are you using them?</p>
      <p class="a">NFTs need to live on a blockchain. You've probably heard of the most popular blockchains: Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin doesn't support NFTs, so many of the largest projects use the Ethereum network. However, transaction fees (also called "gas fees") are VERY HIGH on Ethereum. If you pay around $60 for an NFT on the Ethereum network, you might have to add over $90 in these "gas fees" -- more than the cost of the NFT!! And most of that $90 doesn't go to anyone; it's just value that's destroyed. We didn't like that (especially since we don't want our NFTs to be super expensive), so we put them on the Polygon network. It's another blockchain network that has much lower transaction fees. And Polygon is also supported by OpenSea, the world's largest NFT marketplace, so you'll still be able to easily resell your NFTs later if you want to. MATIC is the name of the currency used on the Polygon network. So our NFTs will cost 30 MATIC to buy (around $65 CAD at the time of writing), plus a SMALL transaction fee (still called a "gas fee" on Polygon).</p>
      <p class="q">OK so how do I get some MATIC and buy one of these things?</p>
      <p class="a">Check out our <a href="crypto.html">crypto tutorial</a> for help with that!</p>
      <p class="q">You've answered my questions and I actually already have some MATIC, where can I get one of these NFTs?</p>
      <p class="a">Go to our <a href="/">minting page</a> and create your unique NFT before supplies run out!! There will only be 1000 of these available!!</a>
      <p class="q">I've heard that NFTs are really bad for the environment. Is that true?</p>
      <p class="a">Ok, first of all, when people say this, they're talking about NFTs using a lot of electricity. There are lots of ways to get electricity that are fine for the environment (hydro, wind, solar, etc). Plus we've been burning coal for power since the 1800s and the world is still here. But <em>if</em> you're worried about the power consumption, let us reassure you: when people say that, they're talking about Ethereum-based NFTs. The Ethereum network uses a technology called "proof of work" which uses a massive amount of computer processing (and therefore electricity) to keep everything secure. Our NFTs are on the Polygon network. We chose it because it's much cheaper for our users, but it also has the advantage of using a newer technology called "proof of stake" that uses much less electricity. Our NFTs obviously use <em>some</em> electricity, but it's on par with the amount consumed by checking your email.</p>
      <p class="q">I have a question that isn't answered here!</p>
      <p class="a">Please contact us by <a href="mailto:freedom.nft.2022@protonmail.com">email</a> and we'll get back to you as soon as we can! You'll be helping other people too, because we plan to update this FAQ if we get similar questions from two or more people.</p>
