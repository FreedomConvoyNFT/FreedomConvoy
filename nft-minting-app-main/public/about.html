      <h1>NFTs for the Canada Freedom Convoy 2022</h1>
      <p>On January 29, 2022, a convoy made up of thousands of truckers converged on Ottawa to demand FREEDOM be restored to EVERYONE.</p>
      <p>Owning one or more of this exclusive set of 1000 NFTs is the perfect way to <strong>show your support for the convoy</strong> and also to <strong>own a digital souvenir of this incredible moment in history</strong>!</p>
      <p>As an added bonus, many NFTs <em>skyrocket</em> in value after the initial minting period. If a bunch of silly ape cartoons are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars each, think what a digital piece of the historic FREEDOM CONVOY might be worth!!</p>
      <p>If you already understand cryptocurrency, have some MATIC in your wallet, and you want in on this NFT right now, <a href="/">click here to mint</a>!!</p>
      <p>If you want in but you don't understand all this cryptocurrency stuff, we have a <a href="crypto.html">crypto tutorial</a> to get you started.</p>
      <p>And if you've got more questions first, check out our <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>!</p>
      <p>It's time to STAND UP and let people know that we want our FREEDOM back!!</p>
